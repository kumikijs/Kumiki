feat(lifecycle): wire the remaining lifecycle events (#81).

Until now only `app.start`, `app.error`, and `route.enter` / `route.leave` made it past the parser; the rest of the catalog from `docs/spec/lifecycle.md` §7.1 was reserved but inert. This change makes the full set behave at runtime.

- **parser**: closed-set validation for `app.*` (`stop`, `visible`, `hidden`, `online`, `offline`, `http-401`, `http-403`, `http-5xx`), `tile.mount(X)` / `tile.unmount(X)` (the tile name is now preserved as part of the event identity, like `route.enter("/p")`), and `route.error("/p")`. Unknown variants are a parse error.
- **runtime**: mount installs `beforeunload` → `app.stop`, `visibilitychange` → `app.visible` / `app.hidden`, and `online` / `offline` → `app.online` / `app.offline` listeners — only for the events the app actually subscribes to. All listeners are removed on `dispose`.
- **runtime**: `tile.mount(X)` / `tile.unmount(X)` fire when a user-defined tile enters or leaves the rendered tree. Codegen marks each user-tile call site with a `_tile` prop; the runtime diffs the marker set across renders so the events only fire on transition. Built-in tiles (`button`, `page`, …) are not tracked.
- **runtime**: a render panic under a routed tile dispatches `route.error("<pattern>")` with `$event = { message, location, pattern }` before falling back to the top-level panic UI (lifecycle.md §7.5.2).
- **examples**: `packages/examples/features/37-lifecycle-events.kumiki`.
