feat(reactivity): stable tile identity — `TileNode.key` end-to-end (#188).

Finishes the coordinated release started in #187. `TileNode` gains an optional `key?: string`, the compiler emits it, and the reconciler consumes it — so keyed children survive insert/remove/reorder without rebuilding the parent subtree, and `<select>` value, `<input>` focus and caret, and event listeners are preserved natively across those mutations.

- **runtime** (`packages/runtime/src/core.ts`): `TileNode` type extended additively via intersection with `{ readonly key?: string }`. `TILE_SKIP_TOP` now includes `"key"` so a key change alone does not trigger `replaceWithFreshTile`. `reconcileNode` gains an all-or-nothing keyed child-list path: when every child on both sides carries a key, `reconcileKeyedChildren` matches by key, recurses on paired children, mounts fresh children for new keys, drops the unmatched old children from the DOM, and reorders in place via `appendChild` moves. When any child is missing a key, the pre-#188 structural walk (position + `kind` + data-prop equality, rebuild-on-length-change) is preserved verbatim.
- **compiler** (`packages/compiler/src/codegen/`): `selector.keyFor` extracts an author-supplied `{key: <expr>}` from a tile call's props block (kept out of both `props.el` and top-level props). `emit-tile.tileExprJs` threads an `implicitKeyExpr` through `TileFor` / `TileWhen` / `TileIf` / `TileMatch`; `TileFor` sets it to `_s.show(<loopVar>)`, and user-tile boundaries reset it. `tileCallJs` wraps every emitted node with a new `_wk(node, key)` runtime helper when either an explicit or implicit key is available. Nested `for` correctly rebinds to the inner loop variable; non-iterated tiles emit no wrap.
- **spec**: new §10.3.10 in `docs/spec/runtime.md` (and JA mirror) documents the additive `TileNode.key` field, the all-or-nothing per-parent matching rule, compiler-emission rules, and the matched-pair migration story.

Old bundles (no keys) still mount cleanly on the new runtime — they just fall back to the structural walk. New compiler output still mounts on an old runtime — the field is ignored. Both packages must be upgraded together to get the reorder-stable-reuse guarantee.
