feat(runtime,compiler,cli): episode logger (§10.5) + `episode-test` (§8.6) (#90).

- runtime: new `createEpisodeLogger` (in-memory ring buffer + opt-in localStorage mirror) plus `MountOptions.episodeLogger` hooked into every reducer / effect-start / effect-end / signal-update / panic seam. Mounted apps expose `app.episodes()` (§10.7). Volatile slots are excluded from `slot-diffs` per language.md §175.
- runtime/testkit: new `_stdlibTest.runEpisodeTest` — replays the logged trigger → reducer chain, resolves effects via `from-log` / `ignore` / `ok(v)` / `err(e)` mocks, and asserts `slots-equal: from-log` / `no-panics` / `no-errors`.
- compiler: `episode-test` added to AST / parser / typecheck / codegen. The log fixture is read at compile time via the injected `readEpisodeLog` (Node helper `nodeEpisodeLogReader`) so the runtime never touches the filesystem.
- cli: `kumiki run --episode-log <file>` now emits real per-trigger §10.5.1 episodes instead of the placeholder one-scenario-step records. `kumiki test` wires `readEpisodeLog` automatically when an `episode-test` is present.
- examples: new `packages/examples/features/44-episode-test.kumiki` + fixture.
