feat(compiler,runtime): close three language-core gaps in language.md (#91).

- compiler: `ui.key` and `ui.hover` (§1.6.1) are now accepted by parser/AST/codegen; codegen lifts them to `onKeyDown` (input/textarea/button) and `onMouseEnter` (any tile) on the enclosing tile.
- compiler: tuple patterns `(p1, p2, …)` (§1.9) are now parsed, typechecked, and lowered. The match-arm separator heuristic was extended so `| (p, q) -> …` is recognised as an arm boundary rather than a bool-OR expression.
- compiler: literal patterns (`| "foo" -> …` / numeric / bool) are removed from the implementation to match §1.9.1's prohibition — they were already an error in the docs but the AST node and codegen path quietly accepted them. `parser` now fails with `Expected pattern`, matching `spec-gaps.test.ts` Gap 1.
- runtime: `TileProps` gains `onKeyDown` / `onMouseEnter`; the universal render hook wires `keydown` (passing `el.key` / `el.code`) and `mouseenter` once for every tile so no per-renderer plumbing is needed.
- examples: new `packages/examples/features/45-ui-key-hover-tuple.kumiki` + scenario covers all three.
