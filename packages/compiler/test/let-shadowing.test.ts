// A reducer's top-level `let` lands in the same JS block as the trigger's binds
// and the positional-binding declarations codegen seeds, so a `let` that took a
// name already declared there emitted a second `const` for it and the whole
// module threw `SyntaxError: Identifier '…' has already been declared` at load
// — with `check` and `build` clean. The language's answer to a name written
// twice is that the inner binding shadows the outer one (errors.md E0119: "a
// name an enclosing `let` or pattern binds is that binding, not the payload"),
// and the nested forms implemented it already; only the top level did not.
//
// These assert on the emitted module actually loading and its reducer computing
// the right next state, because that is the half `check` and `build` never saw.
